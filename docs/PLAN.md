# Golf Photo OCR - Development Plan & Status

## Current Status

**✅ PROJECT COMPLETE**: All 9 metrics implemented with 100% accuracy (360/360 test points)

### Recently Completed (2025-07-18)
- ✅ **File Organization** - Moved `test_validation.py` to `tests/test_ground_truth.py` for better organization
- ✅ **Import Cleanup** - Removed unused `validate_bbox` import from main.py
- ✅ **Documentation Update** - Updated CLAUDE.md and README.md with current architecture and test instructions
- ✅ **Test Integration** - Fixed paths for ground truth validation in new location

## Future Development Priorities

### Optional Architecture Improvements
The system is production-ready. These improvements are optional:

1. **[ ] Separate CLI Logic** - LOW PRIORITY
   - Move CLI logic from main.py to separate cli.py module
   - Only needed if CLI becomes more complex

2. **[ ] Create `utils/files.py`** - LOW PRIORITY
   - Extract file operation utilities (finding images, saving results)
   - Only needed if file operations become more complex

3. **[ ] Add logging framework** - LOW PRIORITY
   - Replace print statements with proper logging
   - Only needed for production deployment

### Not Recommended
- **Dependency injection** - Current design is simple and effective
- **Separate ground truth data** - Current approach works fine for 40 images
- **Performance optimization** - System is already fast enough for current use case

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (97 unit tests)
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run ground truth validation (360 data points)
python tests/test_ground_truth.py

# Process all images
python main.py

# Process single image with debug output
python main.py --single-image photos/sample.png --verbose
```

## Project Architecture

- **main.py**: Core application (285 lines)
- **utils/**: Modular utility functions (validation, parsing, OCR processing)
- **tests/**: Comprehensive test suite (97 tests + ground truth validation)
- **config.json**: Configuration with bounding boxes and ground truth data
- **photos/**: 40 test images

**Key Achievement**: 100% accuracy on all 9 metrics across 40 test images

# Golf Photo OCR - Implementation Plan & Status

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation status of metrics extraction from golf app screenshots.

## ✅ PROJECT COMPLETE - All 9 Metrics Implemented

**System Status**: Production ready with 100% accuracy (360/360 test points)
**Architecture**: Modular design with extracted utility functions
**Quality**: Comprehensive validation and regression protection

## ✅ Completed Work Summary

### Core Implementation (100% Complete)
- All 9 target metrics implemented with 100% accuracy (360/360 test points)
- EasyOCR-based extraction with optimized bounding boxes
- Pattern matching for structured data (dates, shot IDs, yardage ranges)
- Comprehensive ground truth validation system

### Code Quality Improvements (2025-07-16)
- ✅ **Extract shared utility functions** - Created modular `utils/` package, reduced main.py from 535 to 285 lines (-47%)
- ✅ **Input validation** - Comprehensive bounding box coordinate validation
- ✅ **Error handling** - Standardized exception patterns with specific error types
- ✅ **Configuration cleanup** - Removed unused fields from config.json
- ✅ **Dependencies cleanup** - Removed unused packages (pandas, matplotlib, pytest)
- ✅ **Dead code removal** - Deleted unused files and debug artifacts
- ✅ **Test validation fixes** - Resolved type comparison bugs

## Future Development Priorities

### High Priority - Testing & Quality (Next Phase)
Based on codebase analysis in docs/ANALYSIS.md, these items provide the highest value for system reliability:

1. **[ ] Test Parsing Functions** - CRITICAL
   - Unit tests for `convert_date_to_yyyymmdd()` with edge cases (invalid dates, malformed input)
   - Unit tests for `parse_yardage_range()` with various formats ("30-50", "30-50 yards", invalid ranges)
   - Essential for reliability since these handle critical data transformations

2. **[ ] Test `extract_best_number` Function** - HIGH VALUE
   - Comprehensive testing of OCR result scoring algorithm
   - Test with mock OCR results, different confidence levels, proximity scoring
   - Critical since this affects overall extraction accuracy

3. **[ ] Test `GolfOCR` Class** - MEDIUM-HIGH VALUE
   - Integration testing with mocked EasyOCR reader
   - Test image processing workflow and error handling
   - Ensures proper orchestration of utility functions

### Medium Priority - Architecture
4. **[ ] Separate CLI Logic** - MEDIUM VALUE
   - Move CLI logic from main.py to separate cli.py module
   - Improves separation of concerns, though main.py is already clean at 285 lines
   - Can wait until CLI becomes more complex

5. **[ ] Create `utils/files.py`** - MEDIUM VALUE
   - Extract file operation utilities (finding images, saving results)
   - Good for organization if we add more file handling features
   - Currently file operations are simple and contained

### Low Priority - Advanced Features
- [ ] **Consider dependency injection** - Inject OCR reader for improved testability and modularity
- [ ] **Add logging framework** - Replace print statements with proper logging (logging/structlog) for production use
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Profile OCR operations and optimize batch processing for large image sets

### Not Recommended (Low ROI)
- **Separate Ground Truth Data** - Current approach works fine for 40 images
- **Test CLI** - Simple argument parsing, better to focus on core OCR testing

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run full validation test (should show 100% success)
python test_validation.py

# Process all images
python main.py

# Process single image with verbose output
python main.py --single-image photos/sample.png --verbose
```
